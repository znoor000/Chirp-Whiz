# Chirp Whiz

### About this Web Application:
Chirp Whiz started off as a simple idea for bird-lovers who are stuck in the city or don't have spare time.

Please peruse the glossary to get to know the birds on our app and then quiz yourself to see how well you do at identifying our birds! You can check how well you identify each bird in your stats on the User page. You can also view the top players in our leaderboard in the Quiz page.

On the Quiz page you can choose to identify a bird given audio, image, or both. You can also choose the size of your quiz session by choosing 5, 10, or 20 questions per quiz. Lastly, you can limit the range of birds based on habitat - select all habitats to be quized on ANY bird!
